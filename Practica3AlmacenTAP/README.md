# Basic Vaadin and Spring Boot example 

The example contains a view that submits T-shirt orders. The UI is similar to what you might have seen in Vaadin expo booth. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tshirt-shop-example/master/t-shirt-shop.png" alt="T-shirt Shop" title="T-shirt Shop" width="50%">

In addition this version submits the orders to a [JPA backend](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/), validates the data automatically based on [JSR-303 annotations](https://beanvalidation.org/specification/) in the domain object and also contains a view to list current submissions.

## Clone and run the app

You can use it as a basis for your Vaadin experiments. To play around with the example, check it out using git or download the zip. Import it to your favorite IDE and execute the Application class or start the app from command line using: 

    git clone https://github.com/vaadin/t-shirt-shop-example.git
    cd t-shirt-shop-example
    mvn spring-boot:run

The application opens to http://localhost:8080
